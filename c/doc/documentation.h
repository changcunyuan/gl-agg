@section introduction Introduction

cyglet is not  meant to be a full-fledged library but  rather attempts to offer
some  classes that  can be  used to  rapidly build  a  scientific visualization
application. In this  context, each example is self-contained  in an autonomous
directory with its own makefile that  be compiled autonomously. You do not have
to install anything  at all, just to re-use some  objects. However, and because
we've been using C++, there is a basic  set of objects that are used in most of
the examples (namely Object, Vec4f, Widget and Scene).

You're welcome to contribute to cyglet by providing your own documented objects
as well as some running examples that can be integrated into the examples
hierarchy.
